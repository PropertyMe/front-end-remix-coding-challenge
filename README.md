## Welcome to NX!

- [Into to Nx](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro)

This is a monorepo management framework, we'll use it here to help have a library and an app working together.

## Setup

From your terminal:

```sh
npm install
```

This installs everything you need.

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts our Remix App app in development mode.

## Deploy using Vercel

Create a vercel project and set the [Root Directory](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/configure-a-build?query=root%20directory#root-directory) to the remix-app folder
in the general settings: `https://vercel.com/{username}/{projectname}/settings/general`

Then run `vercel` in the root directory
